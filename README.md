# Servlet CRUD Project 🚀

A **simple CRUD application** built with **Java Servlets**, **JSP**, and **JDBC**, demonstrating basic web application architecture with a **Service Layer**.

---

## 🔹 Overview

It implements full CRUD operations:
1. **Create** new items
2. **Read** items list or single item
3. **Update** existing items
4. **Delete** items

All operations are handled via a **Servlet controller** and **Service layer**, connecting to a relational database (MySQL/Oracle).
